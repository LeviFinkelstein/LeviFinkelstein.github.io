\it{This is an ongoing summary of my most fundamental philosophical beliefs. I'll continuously update it as my mind changes.}

\par
\textbf{My mind is primary.} I see philosophy as a private endeavour in the sense of it being about me making sense of my experiences. At any moment I only have access to the contents of my mind, so anything that could meaningfully thought about has to be thought about in terms of the contents of my mind. The folk philosophy we engage in on a daily basis is mostly a bunch of metaphors that make no sense when taken literally.

%\textbf{The "real world" is a metaphor.}
