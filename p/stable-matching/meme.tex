\section*{Problem Statement:}
There are $n$ men each of who rank order $n$ women based on who they want to marry the most to who they want to marry the least. Then the women do the same for the men.\\\\
For $n=3$ you might have something like:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    w_2 & w_1 & w_3\\
    w_2 & w_3 & w_1\\
    w_3 & w_1 & w_2\\
\end{bmatrix}$$ Where the $i$th row represents the preference ordering of the $i$th man from best to worst.\\
And equivalently with the women's preference for men:
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    m_1 & m_2 & m_3\\
    m_3 & m_2 & m_1\\
    m_1 & m_3 & m_2\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

\textbf{The problem:} \textit{Match each man with exactly one woman such that nobody will leave their partner (Stable Matching). Any man or woman will leave their partner if they can do better than their current partner, i.e. there is a man and a woman $(m,w)$ such that both $m$ and $w$ prefer each other over their current partners.}
