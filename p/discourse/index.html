<em><span>This is a list in progress of discourse related behaviors that
frequently irk me when I’m talking to people. This can be anything from
clear dishonesty, to more unconscious dishonesty resulting from
cognitive dissonance, to small psychological defensive ticks, to vague
uninformative unclear statements, to anything else that annoys me. Some
of these I’ll label with terms I read elsewhere, if I don’t know a
fitting term I’ll just make one up. I will update with examples as I
think of them.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Question Dodging</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe X?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Well, I don’t like X, and X is something I think a
lot about.<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> If you learned X would it change your mind on
Y?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> My mind changes all the time, and I have my reasons
for believing Y, like for example...<br />
<strong>Q:</strong> What would you do in this hypothetical
scenario?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> This scenario would never happen.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Unrealistic Hypothetical</strong><br />
You pose someone a hypothetical question that test the consistency of
some principle they claim to hold and they make up excuses to not answer
it like it being "unrealistic" or something like that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Incest is always wrong!<br />
<strong>Bella:</strong> What if an instance of incest had no negative
consequences and prevents an infinite amount of sentient beings from
being tortured for an infinite amount of time.<br />
<strong>Adam:</strong> That wouldn’t happen.<br />
<strong>Bella:</strong> What if it did?<br />
<strong>Adam:</strong> It wouldn’t<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unbelievable how common this behavior is. Adam’s refusal to
answer has nothing to do with the fact that the hypothetical is
unrealistic: suppose he was instead asked "Imagine you have two piles
containing 1 million and 2 million apples respectively. If you were to
combine the two piles into one pile, would you now have a pile of 3
million apples?" What would he answer? "I would never have 1 million
apples, hahahah what a dumb question, you really thought I had 1 million
apples x) ?!" Obviously he would just entertain the question, which
leads us to believe he gave a <em>false reason</em> for rejecting the
hypothetical in the dialogue above.</p>
<p><strong>Unproductive Conversation</strong><br />
<em>TODO</em></p>
<p><strong>"I already answered that."</strong><br />
<em>TODO</em></p>
<p><strong>Ironic Agreement/Answer</strong><br />
Sometimes people will ironically say they "lost the debate" or they’ll
dodge a question with some obviously ironic voice giving some ridiculous
answer.<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yees! You were SOO right, I’m SOO wrong about this!<br />
Of course I believe &lt;thing I obviously don’t believe but now I don’t
have to commit seriously to anything so the discussion can’t proceed and
I have plausible deniability that I was just trolling all along, and btw
did I tell you I don’t take this conversation seriously at
all&gt;!<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think a lot of people just instinctively resort to this type of
irony when they’re panicking.</p>
<p><strong>Universally Applicable Analogy Rejection</strong><br />
Just saying "They’re not the same thing..." in response to an analogy
without an actual explanation of how the analogy fails. Of course
they’re not literally the same thing, that’s the whole point of an
analogy. The analogy intuition pumps a conclusion you’re uncomfortable
with so you flinch and say they’re not the same thing even though they
actually are the same thing. If you get asked how they’re not the same
thing you just keep repeating "they’re not the same thing" over and
over. Maybe you even say "How can you compare X and Y? They’re
completely different things!!"</p>
<p><strong>Crux Allergy</strong><br />
A crux is something specific your belief hinges on in such a way that it
makes a non-trivial difference to what you believe. Since people can be
quite averse to the possibility of having their beliefs falsified
they’ll often repeatedly weaken their claim every time some concrete
crux is identified: (<a
href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NKaPFf98Y5otMbsPk/bayesian-judo">source</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> I don’t believe Artificial Intelligence is
possible because only God can make a soul.<br />
<strong>Sarah:</strong> You mean if I can make an Artificial
Intelligence, it proves your religion is false?<br />
<strong>Tom:</strong> Well, I didn’t mean that you couldn’t make an
intelligence, just that it couldn’t be emotional in the same way we
are.<br />
<strong>Sarah:</strong> So if I make an Artificial Intelligence that,
without being deliberately preprogrammed with any sort of script, starts
talking about an emotional life that sounds like ours, that means your
religion is wrong.<br />
<strong>Tom:</strong> Well, um, I guess we may have to agree to disagree
on this.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>False Crux</strong><br />
Even though it’s difficult to establish cruxes it’s preferable to the
alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John:</strong> I’m really interested in changing your mind on
X, why do you believe X?<br />
<strong>Carl:</strong> I believe X because of Y!<br />
<strong>John:</strong> <em>Spends a few hours researching.</em><br />
<strong>John:</strong> Here’s irrefutable evidence that Y is
false.<br />
<strong>Carl:</strong> Hmm, well, I still believe X because of Z.<br />
<strong>John:</strong> ...<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often people don’t know why they believe things so if you ask them
they’ll just make something up on the spot since they’re not comfortable
acknowledging that they believe something without being able to
articulate reasons. When you falsify the reasons they gave they’re
emotionally not persuaded since those weren’t the real reasons, so
they’ll just make up some other reasons. This is <em>partly</em> why
crux allergy is so pervasive: once you get them to imagine a world in
where some potential reasons are falsified they can more emotionally
connect with the fact that in that world their mind wouldn’t be
changed.</p>
